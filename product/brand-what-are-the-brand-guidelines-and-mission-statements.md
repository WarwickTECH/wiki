WarwickTECH is a charity that exists to build, educate and drive a diverse and inclusive community of technology makers, creators, innovators, enthusiasts and entrepreneurs at Warwick University through exciting speaker events, intimite networking sessions, distinguished panels and flagship hackathons organised alongside leading tech companies, government bodies, charities and industry influencers and allow its members to learn new technical and digital business skills, build exciting technology products, seek interesting career paths and solve the most challenging societal problems.

### Values

**Technical Development**: To offer our members the opportunity to dive into emerging sectors of tech, long before graduating from university.

**Business Acumen**: To allow our community to learn how exciting technologies align with the world at large.

**Human Values**: To put equal focus into the design aspect of our work so as to foster both a love for tech and design.

**Social Impact**: To ensure that every activity we do as a society brings out the best for the community we surround ourselves in.

**Hardware**: To give our members the opportunity to build products that they can hold and give to those that need them.

**Startups & Entrepreneurship**: To empower our members to put their business and tech skills to good practice developing their startup ideas.

**Diversity & Inclusion**: To strive to achieve a diverse community of technologists on campus, including but not limited to gender, ethnicity, race, department and course type.

**Venture Capital**: To bring those that power the tech industry directly in front of the innovators that they push forward.

**Long-Term Partnerships**: To ensure the deep relationships we have with our partners provide more value than either one of our partner’s individual delivery.

**Campus-Wide Pervasiveness**: To continue engaging with other university departments, with the notion that tech is not only for the technical courses
