This document provides an outline of how WarwickTECH's recruitment process works (for non-leadership positions). It is designed to maximise efficiency, to promote cohesion, and to eliminate unconscious biases for a fair and comfortable experience.

### General Form (Typeform)

This is a simple form to allow candidates to present themselves, their startup mentality, leadership potential, broad skill-set, passion for technology, ability to work in teams, and willingness to learn.

### Interviews
   1. Interview 1 (General Overview - Tangential Interviewer [non-\#management\]\)
   2. Interview 2 (In-Depth Review - Sub-Team Lead)

It is near-impossible to ensure that the right candidate is hired without a face-to-face meeting. Interview 1 is used to provide a general overview of our organisation, to build a general profile of the candidate, and to assess whether or not the candidate is able to work together with team members outside of their sub-team - the interview is led by a member of the executive outside of the sub-team that the candidate is applying to. 

**Interview 2** is an in-depth discussion led by the sub-team leader for which that candidate is applying - the aim of this interview is to determine whether the candidate has the correct skills to take the role, and to ensure that the two parties work well together.

### Management Review

Although interviews are very effective to vet candidates, each interviewer has their own unconscious biases which influence their preference over each interviewee. To combat this, \#management will review an overall candidate profile built by their two interviewers and decide whether to offer the candidate the role in question. During this stage, \#management will review the candidate's long-term potential to drive impact within the executive team.
