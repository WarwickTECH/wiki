We believe that everyone has the right to be in a safe and welcoming environment when attending events run, or supported, by the WarwickHTECH. 

More than just a charity, we are a community. Being part of this community means: 

* Committing to helping each other
* Listening to others views
* Setting an example
* Treating everyone equally
* Respecting your environment and the people around you

To represent yourself and WarwickTECH to your very best ability, you must always practice:

* No violence
* No harassment
* No discrimination
* No inappropriate imagery or content

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. **If what you're doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.**

Attendees asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. 

Absolutely **everyone** involved with our activities, including participants, members, sponsors, guests, volunteers, organisers, and our team members, are subject to our Code of Conduct. 

If a person engages in any harassing behaviour, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including (but not limited to) warnings, expulsion, and banning, with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. 

If you are being harassed, or notice someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact WarwickTECH using the contacts below. 

We expect people to follow these rules at all event venues, at social events, and on visits to other events.
