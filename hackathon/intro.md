*"Hackathons are weekend-long technology festivals. They're somewhere you can meet like-minded people, learn new things, and create cool technology. They can sound pretty intimidating... but you don't have to be some sort of genius or a coding pro to take part."* 

&mdash; Tim Fogarty, MLH Commissioner 2015

WarwickHACK is one of WarwickTECH's flagship events and always one of the highlight moments for both the team as well as WarwickTECH's members. Organising hackathons can be a challenge; requiring the team to be organised, on top of sponsorship and ahead of the game with regards to logistics and catering. 

### 1. Getting Started

If you haven't already ensure that [MLH](mlh.io) has been contacted and that a date has been pencilled into their calender for when you plan to run the hackathon.

MLH, **Major League Hacking**, are body that governs the student hackathon league that many North American and European hackathons participate in. They provide a number of advantages to the hackathons that take part in their league;

- Provide a Hardware Lab
- MLH Coach representing the event
- Organisational support
- Event Marketing
- Code of Conduct and Incident reporting
- Freebies, Prizes and Swag!

MLH provides their own guide, the [MLH Hackathon Organiser Guide](https://guide.mlh.io/). This is a fantastic resource to follow along with but bear in mind that European Hackathons often vary from North American Hackathons. This guide was designed with NA in mind.

### 2. What's next?

The next step is locking down a venue. You'll need to determine the capacity of your event and how many people are expected to attend.

You'll also at this point want to check out the [6 month hackathon plan](./calendar.md). This document details what you should be doing with approximate timings, leading up to the hackathon.
