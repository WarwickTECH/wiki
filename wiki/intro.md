Exporting your GitBook content to a GitHub repository is super simple:

1. [Setup GitHub](#setup-github)
2. [Link your book to a GitHub repository](#link-book)
3. [Resolve potential conflicts](./how-can-i-resolve-github-sync-errors.md)

### 1. Setup GitHub {#setup-github}

If not already, the owner's account of the book you would like to export
must be configured to use our GitHub integration. See [this article](./can-i-host-on-github.md#github-integration) for
a detailed explanation of how to setup your account with GitHub.

### 2. Link your book to a GitHub repository {#link-book}

Go to the GitHub section of your book's settings and select the GitHub repository to link this book to and confirm by clicking on the **Sync** button.

From now on, every update made to your book will be automatically reflected on the selected GitHub repository.
