WarwickTECH was established in the summer of 2014 by [Alex Bucknall](#Alex-Bucknall) and [Harry McLaverty](#Harry-McLaverty). Upon registering the organisations as a charity, [Artur Safaryan](#Artur-Safaryan) was brought on board as an additional trustee member. This page reflects the current occupation and contact details of each member of the board of trustees.

WarwickTECH's trustees are non-executive directors that work on an advisory basis to guide the exec team, and drive long-term projects and partnerships e.g. working with WBS and Tech City UK, or organising a venture fund. They form part of the management team to make sure that ideas are put into practice and their influence is tangible. This may include hiring, funding, and expansion.
